This analysis is an optional Capstone project from the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) on Coursera. 

### Background:
A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.
Lily Moreno, Director of Marketing, has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. 

### Business Task:
Analyze Cyclistic historical trip data to gain insights into how the different consumers (Members vs. casual riders) are using the service and discover trends and insights for Cyclistic marketing team.

### Business Objectives:
- What are the trends identified?
- How do the trends differ based on user type?
- How could these trends help influence Cyclistic marketing strategy?

### Tools:
SQL for Data Cleaning, Data Transformation. Excel and Powerpoint for Data Visualisation and Data Analysis.

### Data Set:
CSV files for each month provided by Motivate International Inc. via Amazon AWS Server
